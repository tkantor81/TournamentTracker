<h2>Tiers</h2>
<p>
    FFG’s OP events are broken into three tiers of play. These tiers serve to establish the
    expectations of a Star Wars: Destiny tournament. Expectations are not intended to exclude
    people from participating, but to communicate the experience that players can expect from an
    event. Organizers of unofficial tournaments are encouraged to utilize the Relaxed tier, unless
    their tournament is specifically aimed at competitive players.
