<h2>Participant Roles</h2>
<p>
    Every person present at a tournament is a participant. Participants fulfill specific roles based on
    their responsibilities to the tournament. All participants share the responsibility of acting in a
    respectful manner toward one another. Please read the Fundamental Event Document for a
    detailed explanation of these roles. Participant leader roles are: organizer, marshal, and judge.
    Other roles include player and spectator.
